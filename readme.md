# TriP-LLM: A Tri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly Detection

This repository contains the official Python implementation of **TriP-LLM**, a novel framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate time-series data using pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs).

TriP-LLM is designed to effectively capture both local and global temporal features through a tri-branch architecture â€” **Patching**, **Selection**, and **Global** â€” enabling efficient anomaly detection with reduced memory consumption.
